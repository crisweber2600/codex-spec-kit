# Ideas

## High Prio
* extremem short context 
  always following minimal hierarchical to do list during implementation
    as soon as encountering bug/ implementation error, spawn new bug chat, that just tries to resolve this, tries around, debugs, logs, ..., this fills up context very fast
    and should therefore not disturb the implementation agent, unless it finds out a fundamental flaw in the implementation plan.


* different task types, bug, test implementation, test resolution, refactor, chore, pr, merge, ....   to map to specific agents? tools?

## Medium prio
improved parallelization of tasks? tool to fetch all parallel available task, importance, select manually from, usable by agent's via script? just simple point to task detail description or return tile description
    so implementation agents like claude-flow can work on it!

## Low Prio
extend to ci/cd, cloud deployment, data!!! flow management, ML !!!
